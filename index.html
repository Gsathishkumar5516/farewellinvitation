    <div>
        <p>The intro concludes with a burst of confetti and a 
          final surge of music that leaves the crowd exhilarated and ready for an 
          unforgettable musical journey ahead.
          The music reaches its peak, and the screen fades to black as the intro comes
           to a close. A simple title or caption 
           appears, signaling the start of the main farewell start</p>

        <p>As we engage in friendly matches today,  Carrom is more than just a game; it's an opportunity to bond, 
           to laugh, and to share stories that will create lasting memories.

          So, let's gather around the Carrom board, feel the smooth surface beneath our fingers,
           and enjoy the satisfying sound of coins clinking into the pockets. Let the spirit of 
           healthy competition, sportsmanship, and laughter fill the room as we relish this wonderful game together.</p>

      <div> 
        <p>Today, as we engage in friendly Chess matches, we encourage you to
           embrace the spirit of curiosity and exploration. 

          This is not a battle of physical strength, but a test of mental
           acuity and finesse. It's an opportunity to challenge yourself and your
            fellow seniors in a friendly and respectful environment, where the pursuit
             of victory is just as rewarding as the pursuit of knowledge.
            so, let us also cherish the bonds we create and the memories we share during this remarkable game of Chess.</p>

      <p>we made a hand made invitationcard to all my professiors and seniors,

        it's a tangible expression of thoughtfulness and appreciation. 
        As each card is lovingly hand-delivered to the seniors and professiors, they will feel a deep sense of honor and
         delight knowing that the event has been carefully planned, and their presence is valued.</p>
